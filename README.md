# Automatic Car Parking System Project

This is a desktop based (client/server) Automatic Car Parking system that assigns slots to cars, the project incorporates Sqlite database system to record events and entities. It is entirely written in Python and the Graphic User Interface was designed with Tkinter library. 
The application collects plate numbers as a unique identifier and assigns an equally unique slot number to the vehicle. 
At the car's exit, total time parked is calculated and the bill is automatically generated.
I hope to improve the payment system to generate a reciept. In addition, also enable the system manager to make changes such as cost of parking per hour, slot disabling and adding of slots without having to restart the program.
